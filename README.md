### 1. What is dice game music?

The idea of dice games first originated from [Mozart's Dice Game]. Although many composers experimented with the idea around his time, Mozart takes full credit for the idea. Mozart's idea was to essentially make an algorithm to create a song, to accomplish this he wrote 272 musical measures and a table of rules to follow. The table of rules described how to pick pre-written measures of music one at a time based off of the roll of a die, this resulted in a completely random composition every time and approximately 1.3 * (10^29) different songs that could be generated. Mozart proved that it is very easy to create music when given a set of specific rules and a list of melodic theme, once the list has been created it is not hard to simply rearrange each theme and put it in the appropriate place. [Java Dice Game] shows how simple it can be to write a program that uses pre-written melodic phrases given a set of rules. Although this program uses the measures of music that Mozart wrote, a similar program could be written that creates its own short phrases of music, picks and arranges them somewhat randomly, and uses a set of rules to make sure it is fluid.

### 2. How has this been used?

According to [Generative Music], the British company Sseyo created a program in 1996 that was capable of creating ambient music on the spot. By using the idea of dice game music, Sseyo created a program that would generate melodic themes and randomly arrange them to play fluidly. This program, referred to as Koan, allows the user to choose values for around 150 paramaters such as pitch, rythm, harmony, and tempo and create a new song each time it is run. As would be expected, Koan was programmed to go into great detail on obvious structural elements such as melody, rythm, and harmony but in addition, the program attempts to mimic subtle expressive factors such as micro-variations of pitch and dynamics, shades of timbre, and spatial placement. By adjusting the music to account for these attributes, the program adds a somewhat human characteristic to its composition. Programs like Koan give a good idea of how a simple, minimalistic song can easily be created with the use of code.

### 3. How does dice game music sound?

[Generative Song] is a recording that was made by Koan. Due to the nature in which it creates music, Koan is more suited to creating minimalistic, ambient pieces of music. Obviously, it is much easier to generate music with no overall theme or any general idea than it is to create a piece with recurring themes and deep interaction between parts. Although it has its limitations, Koan still makes very fluid music that sounds like a human could have composed it. 

[Dice Game Song] is a recording of music made with a program that follows the rules of Mozart's Dice Game. This recording shows how fluid the compositions made with the original dice game were. Despite not having any attributes to keep track of the current state of the song, Mozart's Dice Game does an excellent job of creating randomly generate music. This is due to the fact that the rules he wrote make sure that each melodic phrase only goes in a place in the song where it would fit. The basic structure of any song created with Mozart's Dice Game will be the same, meaning that the same type of melodic phrase will be played at the same time in every single song made according to Mozart's rules. The randomness of which exact phrases are picked each time, though, causes every song created to sound different.

There is still a question of whether other types of music can be created using the same ideas as Mozart's Dice Game. Although could be entirely possible, any music with lyrics or any music with a great deal of interaction between multiple parts would most likely be incredibly hard to make sound fluid. Mozart's Dice Game is an excellent way to go about creating minimalistic music such as classical or ambient music, but a different algorithm would most likely be required to form fluid music from other genres.
